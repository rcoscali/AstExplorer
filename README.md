# AstExplorer

This Gnome application, built with gtkmm & glademm is a browser for navigating inside an `AST` (Abstract Syntax
Tree). This AST is generated through Clang and LLVM. Main goal of this app is to prototype huge graph navigation in order to explore some of the concept I saw in [Sourcetrail](https://www.sourcetrail.com).
`AST` (Abstract Syntax
